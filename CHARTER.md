### OpenLab Testing Charter v1.0

Effective 13 May 2019

#### 1) Mission and Scope of the OpenLab project

- a) The purpose of the OpenLab project is to promote the testing and
     verification of Open Source projects.

- b) OpenLab will stay a vendor and open source foundation neutral place where
     testing can be performed on any Open Source project to help promote interoperability and prove out valid configurations.

  - i) All tested software must be under [an approved Open Source
       license](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).

  - ii) Productized versions of Open Source projects are not appropriate for
        testing with OpenLab resources.

  - iii) Testing of upstream Open Source projects should be an indication that
         products based on that upstream code is compatible. Any incompatibility
         issues would be the responsibility and the purview of that vendor.

- c) One of the goals of OpenLab is to test the new "LAMP stack" for various
     use cases. That is, we want to assemble and validate tested combinations
     of different Open Source projects that may be used together to build larger
     solutions that can address the actual needs of the end user.

- d) OpenLab provides a place for different Open Source projects to work
     together, assistance in identifying testing and operability concerns, and
     a place for supporting providers to contribute cloud and physical device
     access to promote the overall Open Source ecosystem.

#### 2) Membership

- a) There are three levels of "membership" in the OpenLab community:

  - i) **General Members** - anyone who participates in OpenLab activities (test
       development, operations, test platform contribution, or promoting
       OpenLab efforts in the greater community) are considered general members
       of OpenLab.

  - ii) **Operations Managers** - those who have participated in the operations
        of the OpenLab CI system and ensured operability of OpenLab
        infrastructure are considered Operations Managers. This group has access
        to the cloud account information and critical systems that make up
        OpenLab and are therefore limited to those that have gained community
        trust and have been nominated into the role by existing Operations
        Managers.

  - iii) **Program Managers** - the OpenLab Program Managers are responsible
         for enforcing the OpenLab mission for all tested solutions and are
         promoters of the OpenLab effort in outreach to other Open Source
         communities and supporting companies.

#### 3) Technical Steering Committee

- a) The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is comprised of OpenLab Program
     Managers.

- b) The TSC is responsible for promoting the OpenLab effort across different
     Open Source communities to help grow involvement in Open Source testing
     and helping onboard new projects to add or expand different technology
     stacks.
    
- c) As part of the TSC, Program Managers will approve or deny new requests for
     testing as appropriate to ensure all efforts align with the OpenLab
     mission.

#### 4) Operations Infrastructure

- a) Operations Managers will help set up new projects with test advice and
     configuration support.
    
- b) Operations Managers will assist new projects with triaging test failures
     and identifying root cause of failures until the projects are able to
     perform these actions on their own.

- c) Infrastructure providers - those that provide cloud VM, container, or
     physical host access to OpenLab for testing - are key to the operation of
     OpenLab.
    
  - i) Providers are donating these resources because they want to support
       the Open Source ecosystem and they believe in the OpenLab mission.

  - ii) OpenLab Operations Managers and Program Managers will make sure these
        donated resources are used appropriately.
